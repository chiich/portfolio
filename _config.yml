# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a Nigerian Frontend Web Developer, currently based in Norwich, England. 
  I mainly work on Public-sector/Government sites, using tech such as
  Drupal 8, JavaScript (ES5) and CSS, HTML5. Web Accessibility is always
  a big consideration, as well as support for IE8 (forgive me) and greater.
baseurl: "/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://chee.me.uk" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
