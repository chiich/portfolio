Nno. Hi.
I currently work as a Frontend Web Developer in Norwich, England, since moving from London (Greenwich, to be exact) where I studied.

I specialise mainly in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript `(ES5, jQuery)`, PHP, WordPress** and **Drupal 8** - more info on these to come.

Feel free to hola at me if you've got something to say. 

Bye.
