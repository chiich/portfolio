Finally! They just arrived! I guess it's time for me to get on with preparing to make `churros`- probably my favourite Spanish snack (first try was at Winter Wonderland).

For reference (as this will be my first attempt at making `churros`), I'll be consulting the following resources:

- [How to make the best churros in the World](http://youtube.com/htmtbcitw)
- [How to make the perfect baked churros](http://youtube.com/htmtpbc)
- [BBC Good Food - How to make churros](http://food.bbc.com/htmc)

The idea behind so many consultations is to afford me the opportunity to identify similarities between the perhaps various methods, and then decide which one (or combination) I wish to try.

Watch out for pictures on Insta! :-P
